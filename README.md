# ⚡ Preemptive Priority CPU Scheduling Simulator

A **web-based simulator** for the **Preemptive Priority CPU Scheduling** algorithm, built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This interactive tool visually demonstrates CPU scheduling, providing **step-by-step execution** and a **Gantt Chart visualization**.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Dynamic Process Input** – Add processes with **arrival time, burst time, and priority**.
- ✅ **Preemptive Scheduling** – Higher-priority processes **preempt** lower-priority ones.
- ✅ **Step-by-Step Execution** – Follow how the CPU **switches between processes** in real-time.
- ✅ **Gantt Chart Visualization** – See the execution timeline of processes.
- ✅ **Performance Metrics** – Calculates **waiting time** and **turnaround time** automatically.

## 🎯 How It Works
1. **Enter process details** – Input **arrival time, burst time, and priority**.
2. **Run the scheduler** – The algorithm dynamically **preempts based on priority**.
3. **Step-by-step execution** – Visualize how scheduling decisions are made.
4. **View Gantt Chart** – Understand the **process execution order**.
5. **Analyze performance** – Check **turnaround time** and **waiting time**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🏗 **HTML** – Structure the webpage  
- 🎨 **CSS** – Style and enhance UI  
- 🖥 **JavaScript** – Implement the scheduling logic  

## 📥 Installation & Usage
